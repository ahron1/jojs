			</dt>
			<dd>

				</p>
 		 	 </dd>
			 <dt>
				  <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq2_desc">

			 </dt>
			 <dd>
				<p id="faq2_desc" class="desc">

				</p>
			 </dd>

			 <dt>
				  <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq3_desc">

				  </button>
			 </dt>
			 <dd>
				<p id="faq3_desc" class="desc">
					Simply copy the url in the browser address bar when the photo is displayed and send it to your friend. Use the browser's inbuilt sharing button to access your favorite social sharing tool :-) 
				</p>
			 </dd>

			 <dt>
				  <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq4_desc">
					How can I access my profile page?
				  </button>
			 </dt>
			 <dd>
				<p id="faq4_desc" class="desc">
				  Since the site is currently in alpha testing, the profile feature is available only to a limited number of users. It will soon be rolled out to all users, please get in touch with us for more detail. 
				</p>
			 </dd>

			 <dt>
				  <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq5_desc">

				</p>
			 </dd>

			 <dt>

					How do you decide which photos are shown and in what order?
				  </button>
			 </dt>
			 <dd>
				<p id="faq6_desc" class="desc">
				  There are a number of factors that go into it, we try and show you pictures that we believe will be of interest to you - this will improve over time. But all practical purposes, one may consider the order of photos shown to be random. 
				</p>
			 </dd>

			 <dt>
				  <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq7_desc">
					Who owns the photos posted to the app? 
				  </button>
			 </dt>

				<p id="faq8_desc" class="desc">
				  Yes. If a photo to which you own the rights has been posted without your permission, please contact us with the link of the offending photo and with some evidence of your ownership of the original. We will review it ASAP. Further, we urge you to bring any issues of IP violation urgently to our notice. 
				</p>

				  </button>
			 </dt>
			 <dd>
				<p id="faq9_desc" class="desc">
				  You can see this on your profile page. Please note, however, that at the present time this feature is in alpha testing and has not been rolled out to all users. 
				</p>
			 </dd>

			 <dt>
				  <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq10_desc">
					What steps do you take to protect my privacy? Does the app comply with GDPR? 
				  </button>
			 </dt>
			 <dd>
				<p id="faq10_desc" class="desc">
				  We, the builders of the app, see ourselves as users first. As users, we have always been fanatical about online privacy. For example, we do not even ask for your full name or complete date of birth, nor do we have fields to even mention this information. Privacy is baked in to the very fabric of the app. And Yes, the app is GDPR compliant by design. We were fortunate in that the GDPR was released just as were designing the app, so we were happy to build the recommendations right into the design of the app.  
				</p>
			 </dd>

			 <dt>
				  <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq11_desc">
					What information does the app store about me? What is your privacy policy?
				  </button>
			 </dt>
			 <dd>
				<p id="faq11_desc" class="desc">
				We could share with you a long lawyer-written document about our strict privacy policy, but instead we will summarize everything that matters into one paragraph. At the time of signing up, you are asked to enter your first name and email address and on your profile page, you can enter your birth year if you want. These are the only personal data we store about you. We also have a record of how you found the app (via google, another app or website, etc.). 
				Given the functionality of the app, we also store the following information about your activity on the app - the photos that you were shown, and how you voted on each photo, the photos you uploaded, any messages you sent to us via the app, and how often you logged in and out. The only external script on the webapp is from Google analytics - which is a necessity, in order for us to see how many people are using the service and how. But that's it, really. Lastly, we would like to note that we do not place trackers on other websites to follow you around the internet. 
				</p>
			 </dd>

			 <dt>
				  <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq12_desc">
					How do you use the information you have stored about me? Do/will you sell it? 
				  </button>
			 </dt>
			 <dd>
				<p id="faq12_desc" class="desc">
				No, we have no interest in selling anyone's information. As to how we use it, we use your voting record to try and show you pictures that we think will be of interest to you. We use your login and logout frequency to identify which of our users love us the most, and roll out cool new features to them first. 
				</p>
			 </dd>

			 <dt>
				  <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq13_desc">
					I love this app, and want to share it with my friends. Why don't you have social media sharing buttons to make this easier?
				  </button>
			 </dt>
			 <dd>
				<p id="faq13_desc" class="desc">
				We are thrilled to hear that you love our app, and we are sure your friends will love us too. The web app does not have sharing buttons because all such buttons are known to track users and place cookies on user devices - we consider this a breach of privacy. On the other had, most, if not all, modern browsers have an in-built sharing button/feature, which is nicely integrated with the social apps already installed on your device. So we encourage you to simply use the share feature on your web browser and share us via your favorite communication or social media app. This small extra step for us is a giant leap towards privacy.
